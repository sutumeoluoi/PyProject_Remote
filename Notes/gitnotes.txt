git init
git remote add origin git://github.com/cmcculloh/repo.git

>>>They're basically the same, except clone will setup additional remote tracking branches, not just master. 
Clones a repository into a newly created directory, creates remote-tracking branches for each branch in the cloned repository 
(visible using git branch -r), and creates and checks out an initial branch that is forked from the cloned 
repository's currently active branch.
